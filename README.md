Fourth Year Project For Gesture based UI Module 

###### Martin Coleman

## Introduction
This project is for our fourth year Gesture based UI Module.

This is a universal app for the windows store. It can run on many platforms such as Windows 10 and Windows Phone. Find out more about universal apps here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/whats-a-uwp

We chose this project as we wanted to work with Thalmic labs Myo Armband. The Myo Armband reads the electrical activity of your muscles to control technology with gestures and motion. 

Find out more about the armband here: https://www.myo.com/.

We had previously used a single myo in our labs and wanted to get two myo communicating together. We decided to create a multiplayer version of the classic game Snake.
